<p>This visualization is meant to compare the amount of times Taylor Swift’s individual songs have been streamed on Spotify, and is categorized with the size of each block showing the amount of times each song has been streamed. The intended audience is Taylor Swift fans, or “Swifties”. This was originally created by a fan and posted in r/taylorswift on reddit with a compilation of other data visualizations about Taylor Swift’s songs on Spotify so other Swifties would be able to see the Spotify statistics of Swift’s songs. ignore this is example text hehe
