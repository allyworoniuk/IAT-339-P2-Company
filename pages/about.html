      <section class ="element">
          <p>We aim to provide high quality, live cockroaches shipped to any address in North America. Our roaches are submerged in a special solution to keep them alive right until your beloved recipient opens their package!</p>
      <h3>What do we do?</h3>

         <p>We sell cockroaches! In any quantity. Want a single cockroach? We got you. Want a dozen? We still got you. Maybe even a hundred cockroaches? We got your back! </p>

      <h3>What can we offer you?</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>A great time</li>
            <li>Lots of fun!</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In all seriousness, have you ever wanted to send a package of something not-so-nice to a not-so-nice person in your life? Roaches are one of the most resilient life-forms on the planet. And what could possibly be worse than a cockroach infestation? If you said white man studying political science, you are correct but we can't send those through mail, so we settled for the next best thing. Revenge? We got your back! (We recommend at least 30 cockroaches in this instance.) A fun prank? We got your back! (We recommend 5 or less cockroaches in this instant.) Wanting to feed your pet reptile? We also got your back!</p>

      <h3>Who are you?</h3>
         <p>You are a sensitive, thoughtful person who wishes to inflict pain onto someone, but in a way that doesn't cause result in serious consequences. Keying their car? Property destruction? Setting their belongings on fire? Classics, of course, but those can potentially lead to some not so fun lawsuits, backlash from people around you, and other dire consequences.</p>
